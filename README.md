## 📦 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## 📥 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

- The page will reload when you make changes.
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- The build is minified
- Filenames include the hashes
- Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more info.

### `npm run eject`

> **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're not satisfied with the default build tool and configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command will:

- Remove the single build dependency
- Copy all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.)
- Let you fully control the setup

All other commands will still work, but they’ll use your own custom setup.
